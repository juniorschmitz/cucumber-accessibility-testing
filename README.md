# Accessibility Testing with Ruby Cucumber
Project created for testing the Axe gem features for testing Website accessibility integrating with Cucumber.

The project has some previously implemented tests, which focus on the Website functional features, the accessibility tests were addeded to the project, new tests are going to be addeded and some are going to be improved.

For installing the dependencies, go to the Gemfile path and type:
```
bundle install
```

For executing the Acessibility Testing feature, one should:
```
bundle exec cucumber -p default -t@accessibility
```

Any questions, feel free to ask me.
